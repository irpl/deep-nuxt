A system built in collaboration with the UWI Physics department's Environmental Monitoring and Research Unit. The electronic system measures and reports on water quality metrics, eg. pH, temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen.

The data is posted to a cloud server and stored in a time series database and is presented graphically via an instance of Grafana.
